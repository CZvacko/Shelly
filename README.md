# Here are some scripts for Shelly  

**Shelly Pro 3 EM (with Switch add-on)** - [Watchdog - exported power](/Scripts/Watchdog%20-%20Exported%20power.js)  
It monitors exported power (to the grid) and can inform user via Shelly Cloud Scene. It can also control switch add-on to control some other devices (relay/inverter). With a minor modification, it can also monitor whether imported energy exceeds a certain value. It is necessary to use a Triphase Profile!   


**Shelly Pro 3 EM** - [Watchdog - Standby power](/Scripts/Watchdog%20-%20Standby%20power.js)  
Monitors whether standby power consumption has been normal over the past 24 hours. A power consumption limit must be set for each phase. If the target is not met, a notification will be sent via Shelly Cloud Scene.  It is necessary to use a Triphase Profile!
